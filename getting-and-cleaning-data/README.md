# How the script run_analysis.R works
The sections in the analysis are:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# CodeBook
The code book describing the variables and other information about the data set can be found in [Codebook.md](https://github.com/ngoharry19/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/getting-and-cleaning-data/CodeBook.md).
